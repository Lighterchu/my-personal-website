                    <p>I work full time as outbouder for a Internet Provider <br>
                    I have been working there for 7 months now and working my way up the chain. <br>
                    I first started as a sales consultant not know what I was getting myself into. <br>
                    Once I started the job I did not know how to talk on the phones and was just chuck stright <br>
                    in with little training. <br> <br>

                    I have been doing for sales for 4 years now, but I have always wanted todo programing. 
                    at my old jobs I have made some programs that make life easy and a litte more simple. <br>

                    I have always pulled things apart when I as younger and want to see how it worked, <br>
                    there were times that I did break it and was not able to fix the problem, how ever I still keep trying to put it back to one pice <br>

                    alot of trail  and error and that is how I go by life I just keep pushing forward intill it works, I dont give up.
