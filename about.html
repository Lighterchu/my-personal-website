                    <p>I work full time as an outbounder for an Internet Provider.
                        
                        I have been working there for 7 months now and have worked my way up the chain.
                        
                        I first started as a sales consultant not knowing what I was getting myself into.
                        Once I started the job I did not know how to talk on the phones and was just thrown straight
                        into it with little training.<br> <br>
                        
                        I have been working in sales for 4 years now, but I have always wanted todo programing.

                        At my previous jobs I have made some programs that make life easier and a little more simpler. <br>

                        I have always pulled things apart when I as younger and want to see how it all worked. <br>

                        There were times that I did break it and was not able to fix the problem, however I still kept trying to put it back to into one piece. <br>

                        I go through life with a lot of trial and error and  I just keep pushing forward until it works.

                        I don't ever give up!
